              I was fortunate to have the professional assistance provided by Canada Citizenship Help. I had
              attempted to obtain Canadian citizenship for two of my adoptive sons and one biological son all
              born outside of Canada. I had attempted to navigate all of the forms and gather all of the
              needed information in my free time. By the time I had all of the information gathered and the
              correct forms filled out, the process had changed and the forms that I had completed were no
              longer accepted. It was a daunting task. The high cost of lawyer’s fees for me was not an
              option. After struggling with the process myself for about 1 full year I found Canada
              Citizenship Help.
            </p>
            <p>
              The people that assisted me, professionally guided me through the forms and gave me precise
              information on all of the paperwork and translations that I would need. They made the process
              easy. I had tried, and could not do it on my own. My decision to use their services has been one
              of the best decisions that I have made. I could not be more pleased with their service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you Canada Citizenship Help for all of your hard work and prompt replies to my many
              questions. Your assistance was paramount in my family reaching a life changing goal. My sons
              options in life have changed dramatically, and our options as a family have increased
              dramatically, thanks to your assistance.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you to all at Canada Citizenship Help.</p>
