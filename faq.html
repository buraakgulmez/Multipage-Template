          <h3>What is a citizenship certificate?</h3>
          <p>
            A Canadian citizenship certificate is a document that proves that a person is a Canadian citizen.
            It can be issued to a person born in Canada, to a person born outside Canada to a Canadian parent,
            or to a permanent resident (a landed immigrant) who has been granted Canadian citizenship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The citizenship certificate is a letter-sized paper document that was introduced in February 2012
            and that replaces the former wallet-sized version. Citizenship certificates issued before February
            1, 2012, continue to be valid. The citizenship certificate contains your family and given names,
            date of birth, gender, and the effective date of citizenship.
            <strong
              >The citizenship certificate is not a travel document. Any Canadian citizen wanting to travel
              internationally must obtain a Canadian passport.</strong
            >

          <h3>Who has a right to Canadian citizenship?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you were born in Canada, you are a Canadian citizen. Your Canadian birth certificate is proof
              of your citizenship.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are a good standing permanent resident of Canada and meet Canadian citizenship
              requirements (residency, language skills, passing citizenship test, etc.), you are eligible to
              become a Canadian citizen.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you were born outside Canada and one of your parents was a Canadian citizen at the time of
              your birth, you have a birthright to Canadian citizenship.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your child was born outside Canada, and you or the other parent was a Canadian citizen when
              the child was born, your child has a birthright to Canadian citizenship
            </li>
            <li>
              Children born outside Canada and adopted by Canadian citizens are eligible for a grant of
              Canadian citizenship.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you were born outside Canada and one of your grandparents was a Canadian citizen when you
              were born, you might have a birthright to Canadian Citizen.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why do I need a Canadian citizenship certificate?</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Live, study or work in Canada without needing any permits.</li>
            <li>Obtain a Canadian passport;</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>What documents are accepted as proof of citizenship?</h3>
          <p>
            The following documents are recognized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) as proof of
            citizenship. Some government departments or agencies may not accept all the documents listed below
            and may require additional documents.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Provincial or territorial birth certificates</strong> (for people born in Canada, unless
              you were born after February 14, 1977,<strong>and</strong>at the time of your birth, your
              parents were neither Canadian citizens nor permanent residents,
              <strong>and</strong>
              at least one parent had diplomatic status in Canada. If you were born in Canada before February

                (some people born outside Canada between February 15, 1977, and April 16, 1981, inclusively,
                to a Canadian parent who was also born outside Canada to a Canadian parent, were required to
                take steps before their 28th birthday in order to keep their citizenship. This is known as
                “retention” of one’s citizenship. If they did not take the necessary steps to retain their
                citizenship, it was automatically lost under the 1977 Citizenship Act. If you think this may
                apply to you and you need more information, please <a href="#">contact us.</a>

          <h3>Who can apply for a citizenship certificate?</h3>
          <p>
            Any Canadian citizen is entitled to apply for a citizenship certificate. Citizens
            <strong>born in Canada </strong> may apply for a citizenship certificate if they wish, although
            provincial or territorial birth certificates are frequently sufficient to prove Canadian
            citizenship.

          <p>
            If you wish to confirm your status as a Canadian citizen, update your citizenship certificate or

          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you change your last name because of marriage, you don’t need to change your name on your

          <h3>What should I do if I need a citizenship certificate urgently?</h3>
          <p>
            Citizenship certificates may be issued on an urgent basis to Canadian citizens who demonstrate an
            urgent need to have their applications processed. Every urgent application will be evaluated on a
            case-by-case basis.
          </p>
          <h3>Is it possible that I am not a Canadian citizen?</h3>
          <p>In general, if you were born in Canada, you are a Canadian citizen.</p>
          <p>
            If you were born in Canada after February 14, 1977, and at the time of your birth, your parents
            were not Canadian citizens or permanent residents, <strong>and</strong> at least one parent had
            diplomatic status in Canada, you are not a citizen.
          </p>
          <p>If you were born in another country:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In general, you are a Canadian citizen if you became a citizen through the naturalization
              process in Canada (i.e., you were a permanent resident [a landed immigrant] before you became a
              citizen).
            </li>
            <li>
              In general, you are a Canadian citizen if you were born outside Canada and one of your parents
              was a Canadian citizen at the time of your birth and if that parent was either born in Canada or
              naturalized in Canada (”naturalized” means that the parent was a permanent resident [a landed
              immigrant] before becoming a citizen). You are the first generation born outside Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may be a Canadian citizen if you were born outside Canada between January 1, 1947, and April
              16, 2009, inclusively to a Canadian parent who was also born outside Canada to a Canadian parent
              (you are the second or subsequent generation born outside Canada).
            </li>
            <li>
              If you were a British subject residing in Canada when the Canadian Citizenship Act came into
              force on January 1, 1947, or you were born outside Canada to a British subject parent who might
              have become a citizen on that date, contact us to find out how to confirm whether or not you are
              a citizen.

          <p>
            If you think that one of the situations above may apply to you and you are uncertain about your
            Canadian citizenship status, we encourage you to call us at 1-888-808-0455 or
            <a href="#">contact us.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>How can I find out if a citizenship certificate was ever issued to me?</h3>
          <p>
            A search of citizenship records can confirm if you were or were not issued a citizenship
            certificate. Some individuals apply for a Search of Records to obtain a letter from CIC to use to
            prove to another government or organization whether or not they were issued a citizenship
            certificate in the past. For example, foreign nationals who are applying to renew a foreign
            passport sometimes need proof that they never received a citizenship certificate.
          </p>
          <h3>Why do some citizenship certificates have an expiry date?</h3>
          <p>
            Beginning January 1, 2007, expiry dates were included on the citizenship certificates of people
            born outside Canada on February 15, 1977, or after, to a Canadian parent who was also born outside
            Canada to a Canadian parent. This was to serve as a reminder to these people that they were
            required to take steps before their 28th birthday in order to retain their citizenship. On April
            17, 2009, the Citizenship Act changed and people who had not already turned 28 by that date no
            longer had to take any steps to retain their citizenship.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your citizenship certificate has an expiry date of April 17, 2009, or after, you do not have to
            take any steps to retain your citizenship. You will still have Canadian citizenship even after the
            expiry date on your certificate. However, your certificate is no longer valid and you should apply
            for a new citizenship certificate.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why some citizenship are certificates wallet-sized, bearing a photograph, and others letter-sized,
            bearing no photograph?
          </h3>
          <p>
            On February 1, 2012, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada introduced a new citizenship
            certificate – a letter-sized document bearing no photograph. Like the previous plastic
            wallet-sized citizenship certificate (a card with a photograph), the new citizenship certificate
            is a legal document that will be used to determine Canadian citizenship status. It is not a travel
            or identity document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Citizenship certificates issued before February 1, 2012, remain valid. This means that any
            Canadian who currently holds a citizenship certificate does not need to apply for a replacement.
          </p>
          <h3>Do I become a Canadian when I marry a Canadian?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Marriage to a Canadian citizen does not give you citizenship. You must first apply for and get
            permanent resident status. Then you must apply for Canadian citizenship and meet the same
            requirements as any other person seeking Canadian citizenship.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Do I lose my Canadian citizenship if I become a citizen of another country or if I live outside of
            Canada for a long time?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Under Canadian law, you can be both a Canadian citizen and a citizen of another country. Canadian
            citizens don’t lose their Canadian citizenship by living outside of Canada or becoming a citizen
            of another country. However, some countries won’t let you keep their citizenship if you become a
            Canadian citizen.
          </p>
          <h3>How to notarize a copy of your documents?</h3>
          <p>
            To have a photocopy of a document certified, an authorized person must compare the original
            document to the photocopy and must print the following on the photocopy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“I certify that this is a true copy of the original document”,</li>
            <li>the name of the original document,</li>
            <li>the date of the certification,</li>
            <li>his or her name,</li>
            <li>his or her official position or title, <strong>and</strong></li>
            <li>his or her signature.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Who can certify copies of documents?</h3>
          <p>Persons authorized to certify copies include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In Canada:</li>
            <li>a commissioner of oaths</li>
            <li>a notary public</li>
            <li>a justice of the peace</li>
            <li>Outside Canada:</li>
            <li>a judge</li>
